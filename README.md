A repository of the projects as i go through the book delivered with the arduino starter kit.

# Structure

Every project should have:
- a circuit diagram
- a picture of the circuit
- source code used in the project
- a readme of the intended meaning and working

every project i will try to make an alteration to challenge myself and learn more about the code and hardware being used.
